These values here, for the most part, discount the 'social welfare' discounting criteria used in some recommendations for discounting for policy (Stern value as an exception).  These values are mostly used for evaluating a more purely financial rationale more based in observable market behavior.  These rates are probably most relevant to be used for Drawdown solutions where government, state utilities, public agencies and policy making bodies are involved in the decision-making with regard to investments.  These values represent a conservative case and, due to uncertainty, and the werighted lower and higher discounting rates (low and high by one standard deviation) should probably be used for sensitivity analysis.",
